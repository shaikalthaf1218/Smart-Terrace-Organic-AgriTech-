# Smart-Terrace-Organic-AgriTech-
This Repository consists of the required sensors used for the Interfacing of Agritech on Terrace through IoT system

Problem Statement:
1.)Lack of efficient technology in agriculture has an impact on agriculture 
2.)The farmer faces difficulty to monitor the agricultural land 24/7 
3.)The user faces difficulty to monitor the crop by going directly to the field. No user-friendly application has been built to control the automatic systems.
4.) Terrace agriculture with enabled cloud connectivity has not been implemented effectively. 
5.) There is no automation for tanks, reservoirs, and irrigation systems
6.) Loss of healthy crops due to chemical fertilizers. 
7.) Deforestation is due to agricultural expansion.
8.) Agriculture Loss due to disasters such as drought, floods, etc
9.) Uprising of artificial agricultural yield due to lack of organic agriculture land

Solution :
The terrace of the house is covered with a heat reflector insulator sheet which is also waterproof
because the excess water should not be diffused into the walls of the house.
1.) According to the area covered by the terrace the soil will be filled for the organic agricultural purpose and the soil is mixed with the manure as well as the different composition of soil to strengthen the yield.
2.) The automatic system for monitoring the field is set-up through
 2.1.) Arduino (Microcontroller)
 2.2.) Soil Moisture sensor (Detecting the moisture level in the soil)
 2.3.)Dht22 (Detection of the temperature and the humidity of the soil)
 2.4.) Water-level sensor (Detecting the water level in the reservoirs as well as in the organic manure container)
 2.5.) Renewable Power Management system (Power source through renewable energy such as solar to the entire system
 2.6.)Smart grid water supply
 2.7.) Esp32 Wi-Fi Module (Used to connect through the internet and transmit and receives commands through the internet
 2.8.)nrf24L01 RF Module (Used to transmit the sensor data wirelessly without Internet connection.)
